          <b> <b>"</b>TEAM DEVKRAFT </b>is a club founded by a group of first-year students Who
          want to make engineering more intersting for every student in <b>DY Patil
          Institute of Technology.</b> To accomplish this milestone we have created
          a Discord Community server which is by the students, for the students,
          of the students. To help the students in other ways, we have created a
          Resource website where we upload all educational books, reference
          books,courses, tools, and almost everything. Not only that but also we
          conduct interactive workshops to teach everything in the most
          effective way<b>"</b>
